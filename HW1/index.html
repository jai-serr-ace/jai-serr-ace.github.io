        <p id="abstract-content">There is a lot of aspects that someone must know or master about in the field of Computer Science. All of them are really important and contribute
            to the overall understanding of how computers work and how to effectively use them. In this website, you will find information about programming 
            languages, hardware, and operating systems. This in done to provide a comprehensive overview of these fundamental topics. And how they interrelate
            with each other. However when all of these get combined or applied, they form the foundation of modern computing and even the way of life.
            Progamming languages refer to the formal syntax that humans have developed to communicate instructions to computers. They serve as a bridge between 
            human logic and machine execution, enabling the creation of software applications, websites, and other digital solutions. 
            Operating systems manage computer hardware and software resources, providing common services for computer programs. They act as intermediaries between 
            programs and hardware, ensuring efficient resource allocation and user interaction.
            Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, input/output 
            devices, and peripherals. Hardware provides the foundation on which software operates, and understanding hardware is essential for optimizing performance,
            troubleshooting issues, and making informed decisions about computer upgrades and configurations.
            With this in mind, hopefully you enjoy reading and learning from this simple overview.</p>
