        <p id="main-body-paragraph">An <b>operating system</b> (OS) is a software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.
        Hardware functions such as I/O and memory allocation and the OS is in charge of acting as intermediary between the programs and the hardware. For instance, when a program needs 
        to read or write a file, it will make a request to the OS, which will then handle the actual reading or writing of the file on the disk. The OS also manages the CPU, memory, and 
        other resources of the computer, ensuring that each program gets the resources it needs to run efficiently. In addition, when a user runs multiple programs at the same time, the 
        OS is responsible for making sure one of those programs is not monopolizing the resources. They also tend to provide a user interface, such as a command line or graphical user 
        interface, to allow users to interact with the computer and run programs, a file explorer system, and various utilities. There are quite a lot of operating systems, but for desktop computers, the most common ones are 
        <b>Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.</b></p>
