        Modern desktop computers have evolved significantly over the years, incorporating advanced hardware and software to enhance user experience.
        The hardware components of a PC primarily consist of the <b>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</b>, <b>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</b>, <b>Random Access Memory (RAM)</b>,
        storage devices, a motherboard, a power supply unit (PSU), a cooling system, and various input/ouput devices and a case. We live in such era
        were any person, could potentially and easily buy this components separately and build their own computer, which is a great way to learn about how computers work.

            The CPU is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer, it is build upon multiple circuits and is responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. 
            It consists of multiple cores that allow for multitasking and improved performance. The CPU's clock speed, measured in gigahertz (GHz), determines how quickly it can 
            process instructions. Additionally, the CPU's architecture, such as x86 or ARM, can impact its compatibility with software and overall performance. CPUs
            also have threads, which are the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler. The number of threads a CPU can handle can 
            impact its ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, with higher thread counts generally providing better multitasking performance.

        <p class="mytext">
            The GPU is a specialized processor designed to handle graphics rendering and parallel processing tasks. It is essential for tasks such as gaming, video editing, and 3D modeling.
            GPUs have evolved to support advanced features like ray tracing and AI-based rendering, enhancing visual quality and performance in modern applications. 
            The GPU's performance is often measured in terms of its core count, clock speed, and memory bandwidth, which contribute to its ability to handle complex graphical workloads.
            There is subtle difference between integrated and dedicated GPUs. Integrated GPUs are built into the CPU and share system memory, while dedicated GPUs have their own memory and processing power,
            providing better performance for graphics-intensive tasks.

        <p class="mytext">
            RAM is a type of volatile memory (meaning, it loses its data when the power is turned off) that provides temporary storage for data and instructions that the CPU needs to access 
            quickly. It allows for faster data retrieval compared to storage devices like hard drives or solid-state drives (SSDs). The amount of RAM in a computer can significantly impact 
            its performance, especially when running multiple applications or handling large files. Modern computers typically come with varying amounts of RAM, ranging from 4GB to 64GB or 
            more, depending on the intended use case. Additonally, its performance can be influenced by something called Dual Channel Memory, which allows for increased data transfer rates 
            by utilizing two memory channels simultaneously. This can lead to improved performance in tasks that require high memory bandwidth, such as gaming and video editing Latly, the
            speed of the RAM, measured in megahertz (MHz), can also impact performance, with higher speeds generally providing better performance in memory-intensive tasks.

        <img src="images/SSD-vs-HDD-2.jpg" alt="compu-storage" width="200" height="auto">
        <p class="mytext">
            Storage devices are essential for storing data and applications on a computer. The two main types of storage devices are hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). 
            HDDs use spinning disks to read and write data, while SSDs use flash memory, which allows for faster data access and improved performance. SSDs have become increasingly popular 
            in modern computers due to their speed and reliability, although they tend to be more expensive than HDDs. Additionally, there are other storage options such as hybrid drives,
            which combine the speed of an SSD with the larger capacity of an HDD, and external storage devices like USB flash drives and external hard drives for additional storage capacity.
            Fun fact: the reason why your computer main storage is called "C Drive" is because in the early days of computing, the first two drives were typically reserved for floppy disks 
            (A and B), and the main hard drive was designated as C.

        <p class="mytext">
            The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all the components of a computer together. It provides the necessary connections and interfaces for the CPU, GPU, RAM, storage devices,
            and other peripherals to communicate with each other. The motherboard also contains various slots and ports for expansion cards, such as graphics cards and sound cards, as well as USB ports, 
            audio jacks, and network interfaces. The quality and features of the motherboard can impact the overall performance and capabilities of a computer, making it an important consideration when 
            building or upgrading a PC.

        <p class="mytext">
            The PSU is responsible for providing power to all the components of a computer. It converts the alternating current (AC) from the wall outlet into direct current (DC) that the computer can use. 
            The wattage of the PSU determines how much power it can provide, and it is important to choose a PSU that can adequately support the power requirements of the components in a computer. 
            A high-quality PSU can help ensure stable and reliable performance, while a low-quality or underpowered PSU can lead to system instability and potential damage to components.

            Those include a cooling system, which is essential to prevent overheating and maintain optimal performance. Cooling systems can consist of fans, heat sinks, or liquid cooling solutions.
            A case is also necessary to house all the components and provide protection against dust and physical damage. 
            Additionally, input/output devices such as keyboards, mice, monitors, and speakers are essential for user interaction with the computer.
