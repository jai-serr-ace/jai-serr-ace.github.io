            <p> A <b>Programming Language</b> is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. 
            Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.
            There is a difference between low level and high level programming languages. The high level languages are closer to human 
            languages and easier to use, while low level languages are closer to machine code and more difficult to use.
            As the matter of fact, during compile or interpretation, high level lamguages are translated into low level languages
            and even sometimes directly into machine code. In the case of translated to a low languages, they act as intructions
            for the CPU and this get translated or assembly into machine code which is the formal binary / logic code understood by the computer.</p>

        <!-- Explain C and the C-like programming languages-->
         <p>C, created by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Labs, was designed to write the Unix operating system efficiently and portably. 
            By combining low-level memory access with high-level structure, C made it possible to write fast, portable system software. Its success led 
            to widespread adoption, standardization, and enormous influence on later languages such as C++, Java, and many others. Today, C remains 
            a foundational language at the core of operating systems, compilers, and performance-critical software.
